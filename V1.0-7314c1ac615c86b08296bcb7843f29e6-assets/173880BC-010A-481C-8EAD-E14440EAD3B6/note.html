<br/></p>
<p><strong>Arguments</strong><br />
coins - an array of positive integers representing the different denominations of coins, there are no duplicate numbers and the numbers are sorted by descending order, eg. {25, 10, 5, 2, 1}<br />
target - a non-negative integer representing the target number of cents, eg. 99<br />
<br/></p>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong><br />
coins is not null and is not empty, all the numbers in coins are positive<br />
target &gt;= 0<br />
You have infinite number of coins for each of the denominations, you can pick any number of the coins.<br />
<br/></p>
<p><strong>Return</strong><br />
a list of ways of combinations of coins to sum up to be target.<br />
each way of combinations is represented by list of integer, the number at each index means the number of coins used for the denomination at corresponding index.<br />
<br/></p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />
coins = {2, 1}, target = 4, the return should be<br />
[<br />
  [0, 4],   (4 cents can be conducted by 0 * 2 cents + 4 * 1 cents)<br />
  [1, 2],   (4 cents can be conducted by 1 * 2 cents + 2 * 1 cents)<br />
  [2, 0]    (4 cents can be conducted by 2 * 2 cents + 0 * 1 cents)<br />
