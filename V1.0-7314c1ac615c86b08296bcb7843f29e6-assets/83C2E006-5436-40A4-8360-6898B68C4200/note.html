(Red is denoted by -1, Green is denoted by 0, and Blue is denoted by 1).<br />
<br/></p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br />
{0} is sorted to {0}<br />
{1, 0} is sorted to {0, 1}<br />
{1, 0, 1, -1, 0} is sorted to {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1}<br />
<br/></p>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong><br />
The input array is not null.<br />
<br/></p>
<p><strong>Corner Cases</strong><br />
What if the input array is of length zero? In this case, we should not do anything as well.</p>
